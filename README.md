# Meme Messenger

## Summary
The player uses a rock-paper-scissors system consisting of three types of memes. The player starts with three memes and must defeat computer opponents in "meme battles" to gain more memes. As the player collects memes, they must engage in increasingly longer battles to unlock more memes for their arsenal. The game is themed as a messaging app and allows the player to "text" opponents for funny interactions.
